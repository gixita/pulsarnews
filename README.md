[**flask_hackernews**](https://hackernews.duarteocarmo.com/) is a minimalistic hackernews clone. 

Built so that beginners who want a hackernews-like application can quickly get to work. 

Greatly inspired by the awesome [flask megatutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world), one of the best ressources to learn more about flask.

It uses: 

- `flask` as a web framework.
- `flask-sqlalchemy` as an ORM.
- `SQLite` as a database.
- `heroku` for a simple deployment.
- Other less known libraries listed in`requirements.txt`
